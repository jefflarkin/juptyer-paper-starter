Jupyter Paper Starter 
=====================

This purpose of this repository is to give a starting point for writing an
academic paper using (Jupyter)[https://jupyter.org/]. Doing so enables
programmatically generating papers with charts and tables from
easily-updatable data. This is meant only as a sample and the work is largely
inspired by (this article)[http://blog.juliusschulz.de/blog/ultimate-ipython-notebook],
which was the basis for the template file. A Makefile is provided for
automatically generating a PDF or Latex file from the jupyter source using
nbconvert.
